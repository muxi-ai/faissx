# FAISSx Development Notes

This directory contains technical documentation, design decisions, and optimization notes for the FAISSx project. These documents record the evolution of the codebase and serve as reference material for developers.

## Contents

### Optimization Documentation

- **OPTIMIZATIONS.md** - General persistence layer optimizations
- **MODIFICATION_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Optimizations made to the index modification module
- **PQ_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Optimizations made to the IndexPQ implementation
- **SERVER_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Needed improvements and optimizations for the server component

### Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

- **prd-gpu-support.md** - Requirements and design for GPU support
- **prd-optimize-persistence-layer.md** - Requirements and design for persistence layer optimization

## Purpose

These documents are maintained to:

1. **Record Design Decisions** - Document why certain implementation choices were made
2. **Guide Future Development** - Highlight areas that need improvement
3. **Onboard New Contributors** - Help new developers understand the system architecture
4. **Track Progress** - Show evolutionary improvements to the codebase

These notes complement the main project documentation by providing deeper technical details and historical context that might not be appropriate for user-facing documentation.
