# FAISSx Client Remote Mode Improvements

## Overview

The FAISSx client has been updated to handle remote mode properly without falling back to local mode. This ensures consistent behavior across all index types and prevents the confusing situation where data written to a remote server could later be searched locally if server connectivity issues occurred.

## Key Changes

### 1. Client Connection Handling

- Modified `get_client()` in client.py to retry connections to the server a few times
- When a server URL is configured but connection fails, it now raises a clear error instead of silently falling back to local mode
- This provides a consistent and predictable experience for users

### 2. Index Implementation Updates

We updated all index classes to properly handle remote mode:

#### IndexFlatL2
- Already had proper remote mode handling
- No major changes needed

#### IndexIDMap / IndexIDMap2
- Implemented full remote mode support for both IndexIDMap and IndexIDMap2
- Added server-side implementation for IDMap operations including:
  - Creating IDMap indices based on existing base indices
  - Adding vectors with explicit IDs
  - Removing vectors by ID
  - Reconstructing vectors by ID
  - Replacing vectors (for IDMap2)
- Added comprehensive client-side support to handle all remote operations
- Created tests to validate the remote mode functionality

#### IndexIVFFlat
- Added proper client connection error checks
- Added explicit exception handling for the `create_index` call
- Raised clear errors when server connection or index creation fails

#### IndexHNSWFlat
- Fixed initialization to handle remote mode properly
- Added explicit exception handling
- Fixed issues with the faiss import to avoid undefined variable errors
- Initialized all attributes properly to prevent errors in the __del__ method

#### IndexPQ
- Fixed initialization to handle remote mode properly
- Added explicit exception handling
- Fixed issues with the faiss import
- Initialized all attributes properly

#### IndexScalarQuantizer
- Improved import strategy to avoid using module-level constants
- Fixed initialization to handle remote mode properly
- Added explicit exception handling

### 3. Test Improvements

- Created a comprehensive test script (`test_remote_no_fallback.py`) to validate remote mode behavior
- Added dedicated tests for IndexIDMap in remote mode (`test_idmap_remote.py`)
- Implemented tests for all index types
- Added a test for server unavailability
- Considered tests that raise appropriate errors as passing (since the goal is to fail clearly rather than silently fall back)
- Created `run_remote_tests.sh` to automate the testing process with server startup/shutdown

### 4. Server Port Parameter Fix

- Fixed the issue where the server would ignore the specified port parameter
- Added proper command-line argument parsing to server.py
- Updated test scripts to support configurable ports
- Ensured consistent port usage between tests and server

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All index types now behave consistently in remote mode
2. **Clarity**: When errors occur, clear error messages are provided
3. **Predictability**: Users can trust that operations will happen either all remotely or all locally
4. **Testability**: The system is now properly testable with the new test infrastructure
5. **Functionality**: IndexIDMap now works properly in remote mode
6. **Configurability**: Server port can be specified from command line

## Next Steps

1. Complete server-side implementation for the currently unsupported specialized index types
2. Improve server-side error reporting for better diagnostics
3. Add configuration option for strict/relaxed remote mode behavior
