## Server Implementation

### High Priority
- [x] Implement server runtime with basic routes
- [x] Test basic index creation, vector addition, and search operations
- [x] Enable Docker container deployment

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add support for additional FAISS index types:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Implement index training endpoints
- [ ] Add specialized search operations (range search, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper deletion through index rebuilding

### Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize persistence layer for large indices
- [ ] Add GPU support via FAISS GPU indices
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed indices
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard

## Client Library

### High Priority
- [x] Complete IndexFlatL2 implementation
- [x] Add basic configuration and error handling
- [x] Test with simple vector operations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement additional FAISS index classes:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Support for training indices
- [ ] Add full FAISS API compatibility layer
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add automatic reconnection on failure
- [ ] Implement local caching to reduce network traffic
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Create TypeScript client library

## Packaging

### High Priority
- [x] Package server as Docker container
- [x] Create PyOxidizer build for server
- [x] Test server deployment

### Medium Priority
- [x] Package client as PyPI package
- [ ] Create automated build process
- [ ] Generate documentation

## Documentation

### High Priority
- [x] Complete API reference for server
- [x] Create quickstart guide

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Optimize for high throughput
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent clients

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete high priority server and client implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Add support for additional index types
3. **Phase 3**: Package for deployment and create documentation
4. **Phase 4**: Performance testing and optimization

## Getting Started

The initial implementation tasks are:

1. ✅ Create server implementation
2. ✅ Create client library structure
3. ✅ Test existing implementation
4. ✅ Create integration tests between server and client

## Decision Log

- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Decided to split the project into server and client components
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Selected FastAPI for the server implementation
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Chose to implement a drop-in replacement client library for FAISS
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Implemented tenant isolation for multi-application deployments
- **2023-05-25**: ✅ Completed test implementation for server and client components
