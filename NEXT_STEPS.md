# FAISS Proxy: Next Steps (0MQ Edition)

> **Note:** The following checklist reflects the planned 0MQ-based architecture. Actual ZMQ implementation work has not started yet; most technical tasks below are pending.

This document outlines the next steps for the FAISS Proxy project, now based on a high-performance 0MQ binary protocol. These items are organized by priority and component.

## Project Setup & Planning Completed

### Server Implementation
- [ ] Create 0MQ server application structure
- [ ] Implement authentication with API keys (in message header)
- [ ] Create FAISS manager for vector operations
- [ ] Implement basic binary protocol for CRUD routes for indices
- [ ] Implement vector addition and search operations
- [ ] Add tenant isolation
- [ ] Create Docker container setup
- [ ] Configure PyOxidizer for standalone builds

### Client Implementation
- [ ] Create client package structure
- [ ] Implement configuration management
- [ ] Implement remote API client using 0MQ
- [ ] Create IndexFlatL2 implementation with API parity
- [ ] Add documentation for client usage
- [ ] Implement drop-in replacement behavior (import faiss_proxy as faiss, configure for remote, fallback to local)

### Project Organization
- [x] Split into server and client components
- [x] Create comprehensive READMEs
- [x] Define client-server binary protocol contract

## Server Implementation

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement server runtime with 0MQ protocol
- [ ] Test basic index creation, vector addition, and search operations
- [ ] Enable Docker container deployment

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add support for additional FAISS index types:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Implement index training endpoints
- [ ] Add specialized search operations (range search, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper deletion through index rebuilding

### Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize persistence layer for large indices
- [ ] Add GPU support via FAISS GPU indices
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed indices
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard

## Client Library

### High Priority
- [ ] Complete IndexFlatL2 implementation
- [ ] Add basic configuration and error handling
- [ ] Test with simple vector operations
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement additional FAISS index classes:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Support for training indices
- [ ] Add full FAISS API compatibility layer

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add automatic reconnection on failure
- [ ] Implement local caching to reduce network traffic
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Create TypeScript client library

## Packaging

### High Priority
- [ ] Package server as Docker container
- [ ] Create PyOxidizer build for server
- [ ] Test server deployment

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Package client as PyPI package
- [ ] Create automated build process
- [ ] Generate documentation

## Documentation

### High Priority
- [ ] Complete protocol/API reference for server
- [ ] Create quickstart guide

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add code examples
- [ ] Create deployment guide

## Performance Testing

### High Priority
- [ ] Measure baseline performance
- [ ] Create load testing harness

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Benchmark with various index sizes
- [ ] Optimize for high throughput
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent clients

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: ⬜ Complete high priority server and client implementation
2. **Phase 2**: ⬜ Add support for additional index types
3. **Phase 3**: ⬜ Package for deployment and create documentation
4. **Phase 4**: ⬜ Performance testing and optimization

## Getting Started

The initial implementation tasks are:

1. ⬜ Create 0MQ server implementation
2. ⬜ Create client library structure
3. ⬜ Test existing implementation
4. ⬜ Create integration tests between server and client

## Decision Log

- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Decided to split the project into server and client components
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Selected 0MQ for the server implementation
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Chose to implement a drop-in replacement client library for FAISS
- **2023-05-18**: ✅ Implemented tenant isolation for multi-application deployments
- **2023-05-25**: ✅ Completed test implementation for server and client components (pre-ZMQ)
