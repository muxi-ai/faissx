### Project Status v0.0.4 ✅
As of version 0.0.4, FAISSx has successfully implemented all high and medium priority features from the original plan, providing a complete drop-in replacement for FAISS with remote execution capabilities.

The implementation maintains 100% compatibility with FAISS API while adding powerful features like remote execution, index persistence, optimization controls, and memory management.

Significant recent optimizations include:
- Robust persistence layer with vector caching
- Optimized IndexPQ implementation with fallbacks
- Enhanced IndexIVFScalarQuantizer with better error handling
- Improved index modification module with batched operations

Future work will focus on enhancing server-side capabilities to better match client-side optimizations.
