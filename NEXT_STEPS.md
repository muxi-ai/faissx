### Current High Priority (in progress)
1. Server-side improvements:
   - [ ] Implement missing vector reconstruction methods
   - [ ] Add reset method for indices
   - [ ] Implement merge_indices functionality
   - [ ] Standardize response formats
   - [x] Fix training behavior inconsistencies
   - [ ] Add server-side support for binary indices and IndexPreTransform
2. Additional index types for 100% FAISS compatibility:
   - [x] Binary indices (IndexBinaryFlat, IndexBinaryIVF, IndexBinaryHash)
   - [x] IndexPreTransform (vector transformations)

### Future Client-Side Optimizations
Once server-side improvements are completed, the following client-side optimizations should be prioritized:

1. **Binary indices remote mode optimization**:
   - Implement server-side binary vector operations
   - Optimize Hamming distance calculations on the server
   - Avoid sending large binary vector batches over the network

2. **IndexPreTransform remote mode optimization**:
   - Implement server-side transforms to avoid sending larger untransformed vectors over the network
   - Support transform serialization for transfer between client and server
   - Add server-side vector transformation endpoints
   - Implement distributed training for transforms that require significant computation (e.g., PCA)

These optimizations will significantly improve network efficiency and overall system performance for remote operation mode.

### Future Work (Low Priority)
The following items are deferred to future releases:

#### Server-Side Enhancements
1. GPU support for server-side operations
2. Advanced persistence optimizations for large indices:
   - Progressive/lazy loading
   - Optimized metadata storage with MessagePack
   - Index chunking and sharding
   - Compression for stored indices
   - Adaptive chunk sizing
3. Monitoring dashboard and performance metrics
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed indices
5. High availability configuration
6. Support for distributed indices

#### Ecosystem Extensions
1. Additional language clients (TypeScript, Go, etc.)

### Project Status v0.0.3 ✅
As of version 0.0.3, FAISSx has successfully implemented all high and medium priority features from the original plan, providing a complete drop-in replacement for FAISS with remote execution capabilities.

The implementation maintains 100% compatibility with FAISS API while adding powerful features like remote execution, index persistence, optimization controls, and memory management.

Significant recent optimizations include:
- Robust persistence layer with vector caching
- Optimized IndexPQ implementation with fallbacks
- Enhanced IndexIVFScalarQuantizer with better error handling
- Improved index modification module with batched operations

Future work will focus on enhancing server-side capabilities to better match client-side optimizations.
