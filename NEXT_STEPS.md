# FAISSx: Next Steps

This document outlines the current status and next steps for the FAISSx project, which provides a high-performance vector database proxy using FAISS and ZeroMQ.

## Current Status

### Project Infrastructure (Complete âœ…)
- [x] Project renamed from FAISS-Proxy to FAISSx
- [x] Directory structure reorganized (faissx, client, server, examples, data)
- [x] Build system configured (setup.py, MANIFEST.in)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Basic Docker deployment

### Server Implementation (In Progress ðŸš§)
- [x] Create ZeroMQ server application structure
- [x] Implement authentication with API keys
- [x] Create FAISS manager for vector operations
- [x] Implement basic binary protocol for CRUD routes for indices
- [x] Implement vector addition and search operations
- [x] Add tenant isolation
- [x] Create Docker container setup

### Client Implementation (Planned ðŸ“‹)
- [x] Create client package structure
- [ ] Implement configuration management
- [ ] Implement remote API client using ZeroMQ
- [ ] Create IndexFlatL2 implementation with API parity
- [ ] Add documentation for client usage
- [ ] Implement drop-in replacement behavior

## Next Milestones

### Server Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for additional FAISS index types:
  - [ ] IndexIVFFlat
  - [ ] IndexHNSW
  - [ ] IndexPQ
- [ ] Implement index training endpoints
- [ ] Add specialized search operations (range search, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper deletion through index rebuilding
- [ ] Add benchmarking tools

### Client Library Development
- [ ] Complete IndexFlatL2 implementation
- [ ] Add basic configuration and error handling
- [ ] Test with simple vector operations
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Implement additional FAISS index classes
- [ ] Support for training indices

### Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Create standalone binaries
- [ ] Publish Docker images to Docker Hub
- [ ] Create automated build and test pipeline

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Optimize persistence layer for large indices
- [ ] Add GPU support via FAISS GPU indices
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed indices
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Support for distributed indices
- [ ] High availability configuration

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
1. Complete client implementation for IndexFlatL2
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Publish to PyPI
4. Create detailed documentation

### Medium Priority
1. Add support for more index types
2. Implement index training
3. Create benchmarking tools
4. Add performance optimizations

### Low Priority
1. GPU support
2. Monitoring dashboard
3. Additional language clients (TypeScript, Go, etc.)

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions to the FAISSx project. Here are some ways to get started:

1. Try out the current implementation and provide feedback
2. Help with client implementation
3. Add support for additional FAISS index types
4. Improve documentation
5. Create examples
